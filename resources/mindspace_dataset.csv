U1,admiration,2020-12-23,This is awesome. Always been wanting more historically accurate representations of ancient Chinese military equipment and soldiers and not the almost fantasy level stuff seen in drama's.
U1,admiration,2020-12-27,Good question... maybe it has something to do with expanding their international flights? Although if I remember correctly they unload you somewhere else to go through customs.
U1,admiration,2021-01-13,I don‚Äôt think they really thought through the ramifications of putting a bunch of angry women through rigorous physical exercise with weapons. That uprising would be glorious!
U1,admiration,2021-02-14,I think they're good optics. Or do you not think that being openly intolerant toward surveillance encourages others to be openly intolerant toward surveillance in turn?
U1,admiration,2021-03-11,Our ancestors took this land at great loss and developed into something greater than they were capable of being. Their descendants have the rightful claim to the land.
U1,admiration,2021-01-03,"I read through this whole chain and your patience is absolutely commendable. Good on you for explaining it in such a level fashion to someone so willfully ignorant,"
U1,admiration,2021-02-14,Damage values would be fantastic. I also really appreciate having detailed kit information. We no longer use attachments so listing specializations would be nice.
U1,admiration,2021-03-14,Pretty fucking brutal when your starting front court is 0-10 from the field. Whatever. I figured we would split this back to back anyway. Good game for our big 3.

U1,anger,2021-02-28,I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
U1,anger,2021-03-13,"Who the fuck reads news *papers* anymore? Baby boomers. This kind of crap is totally written by a ""journalist"" in need of a safe place."
U1,anger,2021-02-01,Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
U1,anger,2021-02-18,"I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly."

U1,anger,2021-03-25,"Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. "
U1,anger,2020-12-23,And what a fuckton of karma it was. It‚Äôs fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.

U1,anger,2021-03-05,"I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
U1,anger,2021-02-07,"I hated him too, just keep watching. Every character has their own personal journey which is such an admirable aspect of this show."

U1,disgust,2021-01-21,The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
U1,disgust,2020-12-31,dae [NAME] IS MOMMY FUCK MY ASS WITH A BACKHOE MOTHER YES GAWD *tongue pop* WHAT A TALENTED ACTRESS BUT ALSO PARENTAL FIGURE
U1,disgust,2021-01-13,Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.
U1,disgust,2021-01-31,"First thought: OHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! Okay, time for me to submerge and introduce this MOTHAFUCKAS EYE BALLS to these hands"
U1,disgust,2021-02-17,worst is when people with dogs think they know what it's like to be a parent omg like you dont even know YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
U1,disgust,2021-02-14,"This is really disgusting, the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around, Shame that a few c*nts gotta do shit like this."

U1,disgust,2021-02-27,You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
U1,disgust,2021-03-25,The SJW community. I hate it too cause they are the ancestors of the Civil Rights Movement who where absolutely awesome
U1,disgust,2021-02-28,"But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad."
U1,disgust,2021-03-27,This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
U1,disgust,2021-03-25,I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
U1,embarrassment,2021-02-05,Yep. The problem is definitely regulation and not wealth hoarding supported by corporate money controlling politics. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires unite!
U1,excitement,2021-02-07,Keep going sgtsoyboy... we are turning the corner this year and I will personally enjoy bashing another Superbowl-less season for the qweefs this offseason.
U1,excitement,2020-12-19,Happy birthday! Drinking one for you tonight. When you get up tomorrow you can take the first step to making sure next years birthday will be better!
U1,excitement,2021-02-10,"Stomping the Titans before Christmas in 2012. I got to watch nearly every playmaker do something big, and got to razz my Titans fan buddy all day. "
U1,excitement,2021-01-19,Hell yeah. I'm really just thinking about the irony and double standard of the Left. It's amazing that these people are that cognitive dissonant.
U1,excitement,2021-02-04,[NAME] has progressed so much this season. Took him a little bit to start getting his confidence but I‚Äôm a lot more excited about his future now
U1,excitement,2021-02-14,"I'm excited for them, but I can understand why anyone wouldn't be. They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game"
U1,fear,2020-12-20,"I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'."
U1,fear,2020-12-28,I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
U1,fear,2021-03-14,"Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. "
U1,fear,2021-01-23,"I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
U1,fear,2021-03-21,"Definitely accurate, lasted about a month total in a Disney ‚Äúinternship‚Äù program... was more like slavery. Terrible experience that ruined Disney for me"
U1,fear,2021-02-04,Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
U1,fear,2021-02-28,Yeah it‚Äôs fine. Some supplements contain Ashwagandha which affects the gaba receptors so be cautious if you‚Äôre already on gabapentin or a beta blocker
U1,fear,2021-02-22,"> So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
U1,fear,2021-03-28,This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past ‚Äúwas‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhad been.‚Äù
U1,fear,2020-12-19,"The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented. The same way the federal government does it, with income taxes."

U1,fear,2021-02-27,"dude, thats grave danger for sure. thats terrifying. he was a predator for young men interested in sports cars. luring in for diabolic purposes!!"
U1,fear,2021-02-13,What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
U1,fear,2021-03-22,"Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna "
U1,fear,2020-12-24,This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
U1,fear,2020-12-30,"I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda"
U1,fear,2021-02-07,Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
U1,fear,2021-01-17,We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
U1,fear,2021-01-20,That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
U1,fear,2021-01-21,"Man, dropping is rather dreadful but nothing‚Äôs more dreadful when you can reach into your pockets expecting it to be there and it isn‚Äôt "

U1,fear,2021-03-06,Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
U1,fear,2021-03-14,"i had all of those. checked myself with a GP and found out i had low iron, migraines and needed to visit the therapist re my anxiety."
U1,fear,2021-03-26,All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
U1,fear,2021-01-16,"That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. "
U1,fear,2021-02-28,"Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying."
U1,fear,2021-01-25,">Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
U1,fear,2020-12-11,"That‚Äôs not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that‚Äôs a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."
U1,fear,2021-03-26,I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
U1,gratitude,2021-01-23,"Hi u/CareeningDirigibug, thanks for posting this however I am afraid it has been removed as this video has already been posted within the last week. Hope you understand."
U1,gratitude,2021-02-25,I understand completely. People have no memory or understanding of the true horror of these diseases. I am truly glad you have decided to vaccinate. Blessings [NAME]
U1,gratitude,2021-01-14,Yes Thank you ! Someone might try to sue me because they pulled out and got pregnant ... use full body condoms if you think Facebook should support your baybeeees
U1,gratitude,2021-03-06,Thankfully. We have highly responsible gun owners and our gun control is fairly effective. We have way less violence and people generally can still enjoy them.
U1,gratitude,2021-02-01,"Thank you for not just writing some bullshit and actually being creative. Followed this sub for scary ideas but usually get cliche garbage. So Again, thanks"
U1,gratitude,2021-01-16,"I am just asking for job-advice. I have dealt with this condition for a long time, and know what medical therapies are effective and feasible for me. Thanks"
U1,grief,2021-02-18,Thats insane. Someone died like 2 years ago after a bolt got kicked up by a truck and went through his windshield and hit him on 146 in LaPorte
U1,grief,2021-02-21,They really aren‚Äôt people. They were slavers. Civilized people should have only one answer to that sort of behaviour: violence and death.
U1,grief,2021-02-20,Well that‚Äôs not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
U1,grief,2021-01-01,"I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile."

U1,grief,2020-12-12,My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.
U1,grief,2021-01-21,I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
U1,grief,2021-03-20,The attempt was successful. He's crying and not talking to them because they're actually dead.
U1,grief,2021-03-04,"of course not, [NAME] and [NAME] were great friends and anyway, he's been dead since 2016."
U1,grief,2021-02-06,"[NAME]. Gun crimes are pretty much unheard of on that side of the pond, isn't it? RIP."
U1,joy,2021-02-28,"I like flirting so this is what I enjoy doing, plus ordinary flirting is outcome independent. Direct approach is outcome dependent. Either way it's all part of the fun!"
U1,joy,2021-01-04,You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
U1,joy,2021-03-05,"I stoped telling story because ''[NAME]""*. Drawing makes me look intensely people to measure their ratio and understand their shapes. That's my new fun"
U1,joy,2021-01-09,I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
U1,joy,2021-01-17,Coincidence..only 2 hours ago I opened a roll of US quarters Ive had for a few months..16 regular pcs...and 24 states quarters. 24..quite happy.

U1,nervousness,2021-01-04,Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.
U1,nervousness,2021-01-19,"Yes, once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down votes. Lately,every once in a while I comment encouraging good attitude."
U1,nervousness,2021-01-31,I already called the county I got married in trying to find out about it but they had nothing on either of us about a divorce.. Im so anxious.
U1,nervousness,2021-03-14,I find sativa makes me paranoid/anxious as hell. Indica calms me down more. Smoking too much of any strain makes me anxious by time though

U1,nervousness,2020-12-13,I was trying to make the point that the patient is still having a seizure; it's just not visible because they are paralyzed.
U1,nervousness,2021-03-11,You're right to be nervous. That happened near my college's campus when I was a student. She lost everything in her wallet.
U1,optimism,2021-02-06,It's also about anyone else who feels down or attacked by misandrist social signals. Finding ways to counteract these signals and their effects is a worthwhile pursuit.
U1,optimism,2020-12-24,depending on his age there might still be hope. brain development supposedly stops around age 25 so if he gets ample simulation and nutrients perhaps there can be hope
U1,optimism,2021-01-17,I'm not counting on them getting elected. I'm counting on them putting enough pressure on the Conservatives to actually become at least a little conservative.
U1,optimism,2021-03-11,"Yeah, hopefully the lesson learned from this is that our level of airport security is stupid and unnecessary and not that [NAME] is risking another 9/11 "
U1,optimism,2021-01-19,Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
U1,optimism,2021-02-25,The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won‚Äôt witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.

U1,realization,2020-12-25,I guess I dont see a difference between harassing someone and pretending to harass by actually harassing them. Their motivation or pre planning doesnt really change anything right?
